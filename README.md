# CS-Project-I
 NourishKids is a project aimed at addressing two critical issues: reducing food wastage and improving nutrition for vulnerable children. The system works by collaborating with companies that have surplus food and redistributing it to children's homes, ensuring that nutritious meals reach those who need them the most.
 Overview
Food wastage is a global problem that not only leads to significant economic losses but also has adverse environmental and social impacts. At the same time, there are many children's homes and organizations catering to vulnerable children who struggle to provide nutritious meals due to limited resources. NourishKids aims to bridge this gap by connecting these two aspects and ensuring that surplus food reaches the children in need.
The core idea of NourishKids is to establish partnerships with companies that have surplus food due to various reasons, such as excess production, nearing expiration dates, or packaging defects. By collaborating with these companies, NourishKids collects the surplus food and distributes it efficiently to children's homes, orphanages, and other organizations catering to vulnerable children.

Features
Food Donation Management: NourishKids provides a platform for companies to donate their surplus food. The system facilitates the collection, storage, and inventory management of donated food items.

Inventory Tracking: NourishKids keeps track of all donated food items, including their quantity, expiry dates, and nutritional information. This ensures efficient utilization and prevents wastage of donated food.

Distribution System: The system coordinates the logistics of delivering the donated food to various children's homes and organizations. It optimizes routes, schedules deliveries, and ensures that the food reaches the intended recipients in a timely manner.
